4.4.26. PsychoPy 1.90.1 stand alone is recommended. 

Tested on Windows PsychoPy 1.90.1.

## Usage
As demonstrated in the demo scripts, the toolbox is configured through
the following interface:
1. retrieve (default) settings for eye tracker of interest: `settings =
SMITE.get_defaults('trackerName');` Supported tracker Names are `HiSpeed`,
`RED`, `REDm`, `RED250mobile`, `REDn_Scientific`, and `REDn_Professional`.
2. edit settings if wanted (see below)
3. initialize SMITE using this settings struct: `EThndl = SMITE(settings)`

ToDos:
1. Implement file transfer in two computer setups
2.
